# Rejecting Modernity: Building a Website with Pure Javascript

While it may be true that Javascript is often seen as the black sheep of development - loved by some, but hated by many (including some of its supporters) - I've been using it for the past three years of my tech career, like many other new developers in the field. While some may argue that it's a problematic language that promotes bad habits, I believe that the unique quirks and peculiarities of Javascript have inspired me to write code in ways that no other language has. In fact, it's these quirks that motivated me to reject modern development practices and return to basics with a personal project - the very website you're reading this on. I wrote it entirely in pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS, without the use of any libraries, frameworks, or other external tools.
It's been an incredible experience to build something from scratch and truly understand how things work, without relying on the code of others. I've learned a lot through reading documentation and I hope to keep learning more.
